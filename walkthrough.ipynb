    "# Model Merging through Tensor Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "Model merging is an innovative technique that combines multiple fine-tuned models to create a new model that leverages the strengths of its components. This approach can lead to improved performance, broader knowledge, or specialized capabilities. Our library simplifies the process of model merging by treating it as operations on dictionaries, making it accessible and flexible for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "1. **StateDict Abstraction**: Maps `nn.Module` objects into dictionaries, enabling easy manipulation through basic arithmetic operations.\n",
    "2. **@dict_map Decorator**: Simplifies development by allowing operations on layers of mergeable modules.\n",
    "3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a functional approach with a focus on extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of our approach:\n",
    "- Ease of use: Intuitive dictionary-based operations\n",
    "- Flexibility: Supports various merging strategies\n",
